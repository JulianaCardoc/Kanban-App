## Project Description
Kanban Board App is an application that allows users to create boards following the Kanban methodology. It provides the functionality to sort tasks (represented by cards) in priority order and classify them by status (represented by columns).

## Project Context
This application is developed as a technical assessment for a trainee opportunity as a Full Stack Developer, focusing on Angular, Node.js, and related technologies. It serves as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of a larger potential project. While it currently offers basic functions and an authentication layer, it has the potential to evolve into a comprehensive project management and tracking tool.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js environment
- Angular (Front-end framework)
- Tailwind CSS (Styling tool)
- Angular CDK (Component Development Kit)
- Angular Reactive Forms

## Features
- User Authentication (Login functionality)
- Creation of Kanban boards
- Addition and management of tasks as cards
- Organization of cards into columns representing different statuses
- Drag and drop functionality for easy task management
- Priority sorting for tasks

## Future Enhancements
While the current version demonstrates core functionalities, there are several areas for potential improvement:

- Implementation of a robust data persistence method
- Integration with a dedicated backend API for enhanced data management
- Expansion of user management features
- Addition of collaborative features for team projects
- Implementation of advanced analytics and reporting tools

Please note that the current version utilizes available APIs for testing purposes. Future iterations will focus on developing a custom backend solution for improved functionality and data management.
